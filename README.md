# PassengerSecurity

Railways provide the cheapest and most convenient mode of passenger transport both for
long distance and suburban traffic. Security of passengers and their belongings with the
maintenance of railway resources is of paramount importance for Indian Railways.
Although Indian Railways have progressed a lot, both quantitatively and qualitatively,
during the last few years, this system is still plagued by a number of problems which
require immediate attention. Indian Railways serve nearly 23 million passengers every
day therefore security and safety of these passengers especially women and other
vulnerable sections of society is of paramount importance to the system. There is no
centralized system for handling all such security and railway maintenance related issues.
Present systems and ways are not efficient.
A software solution needs to be provided for online registration of complaints over entire
network of Indian Railway for speedy initiation of action by GRP
Objectives:
 Build a website for passengers to register a complaint to GRP.
 Fetch the location of passengers through google maps API.
 Fetch the route of the train through Indian Railways API.
 Transfer the complaint to nearest/next halt.
 GRP side website to serve the complaints.
 To avail this service of GRP through Android Application.
 Use of Android volley API to send HTTP GET and POST requests.
 To avail the customer with a facility of checking status and giving feedback for
their complaints.
 To ease the passengers in contacting the GRP and registering a complaint during
journey
